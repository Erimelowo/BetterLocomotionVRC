# BetterLocomotion
A mod to enhance locomotion for VRChat using MelonLoader.  
Continuation of BetterDirections (https://github.com/d-magit/VRC-Mods)

## Features
- Fixes the inconvenience that happens because of Euler angles when moving while looking up, usually while laying down or cuddling, for example.
- Choose between head, hip or chest locomotion. This allows hip/chest-based locomotion, making you move towards your hip/chest instead of your head like Decamove.
- Compatible with IKTweaks or default VRChat IK.
- Hip/chest locomotion compatible with 4-point tracking or 6-point tracking.

## Dependency
- UIExpansionKit (https://github.com/knah/VRCMods) to change locomotion mode (settings).

## Installation
**Before installing: Modding is against VRChat's ToS. Be careful while using this as it modifies player movement! We are not responsible for any punishments.**  
Install [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/) and drop [BetterLocomotion.dll](https://github.com/Louka3000/BetterLocomotion/releases/latest/download/BetterLocomotion.dll) in your mods folder. You will also need [UIExpansionKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/releases/latest/download/UIExpansionKit.dll).  
You can also use [VRCMelonAssistant](https://github.com/knah/VRCMelonAssistant/releases/latest/download/VRCMelonAssistant.exe) to simplify installation.
