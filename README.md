# HipLocomotion
A Hip Locomotion mod for VRChat using MelonLoader.

## Features
- Choose between head, hip or chest locomotion. This allows hip/chest-based locomotion, making you move towards your hip/chest instead of your head.

## Dependency
- UIExpansionKit (https://github.com/knah/VRCMods) to change settings.

## Special Thanks
- Davivi (BetterDirection mod: https://github.com/d-magit/VRC-Mods)
