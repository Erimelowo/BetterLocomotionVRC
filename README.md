# BetterLocomotion
A mod to enhance locomotion for VRChat using MelonLoader.
Continuation of BetterDirections (https://github.com/d-magit/VRC-Mods)

## Features
- Fixes the inconvenience that happens because of Euler angles when moving while looking up, usually while laying down or cuddling, for example.
- Choose between head, hip or chest locomotion. This allows hip/chest-based locomotion, making you move towards your hip/chest instead of your head.
- Compatible with IKTweaks or default VRChat IK.
- Compatible with 4-point tracking or 6-point tracking.

## Dependency
- UIExpansionKit (https://github.com/knah/VRCMods) to change locomotion mode (settings).
